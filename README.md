# Low-Cost Automated Alcohol Dispenser for Office COVID-SOLUTION

## ABSTRACT : 

Build the simplest low-cost Automated Alcohol Dispenser without using Arduino. Keep your hands clean by
filling it with liquid soap, hand sanitizer or with rubbing alcohol. By reducing physical contact, an automated dispenser
keeps virus from spreading around in communal areas.

## INTRODUCTION : 

COVID 19 a biggest pandemic cause in 2020, we all have to thing about how to be safe at working place, education
systems, worship location and super market like mall etc. As a individual citizen of India itâ€™s our responsibility to help the
nation with the growth in economic with good health.

According to survey it is found that the major reason of spread of COVID 19 is physical contact with the person infected.
Government had guided throughout the Lockdown period how to be safe from the COVID 19. The biggest thing is
washing hand regularly and keeping distance from the person who is infected.
So as now our country is under unlockdown 1.0 where again the offices are open and people can work in the firm. Now
this gave me the idea to built a project which is useful for the people returning back to their work and studied. As when
the person is at home, he regularly washes hand whenever he needs but in office it is not possible as you have lots of
work.

Here is my project name Low Cost Automated Alcohol Dispenser (COVID-SOLUTION) which is fully automatic, what you
have to do just put your hand in front of it and wash hand no need to stand from your position it is so small that it can
be kept at your desk and use any time . This is the novel solution for the office, education system, worship places, malls
etc.

## Existing solutions: 

The existing solution in the market is expensive and big in cross-section area not easy to setup. Basically they use the
Arduino and other microcontroller to control their sanitizer which make it expensive and increase difficulty for the
company to setup as just after the lockdown it is impossible for the small investor to setup these in there firm for there
worker.
